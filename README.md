# macOS Auth Test
## by ME!

Here are two different macOS Authentication tests apps I made...
kinda boring but they exist!

## Requirements 
macOS **Ventura 13.0** or later
no it doesn't work on my favorite version of Monterey which is unfortunate but if any of y'all want it ig just let me know

## Username and Passwords
User: admin
Password: admin

User: user1
Password: password1

and it keeps going like that until user 3. if you learned patterns in primary im sure you'll figure it out

thats it thanks
